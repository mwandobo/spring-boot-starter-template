 //NOTIFICATIONS
 all notifications are sent through a notification service

 notification service will receive an array of notifications channels to send notifications
 it will also receive other necessary data to make sure it can accommodate different channels
 for starters it will receive information that to be sent to email

 it will decide where and how many channels to send information

 for email sending
 a payload is sent to notification services stating which channel it will use
 it also specify the context since we will be using template
 also will specify the list of the recipients emails

 then the request is further forwarded to emailSending service
 where different methods are defined to send different kind of messages

 emailSending service have the email configuration class where all email configs are taking place
email are sent when
    new user is created
    recovery email
    new approval level has been created
    approval has been done


for the case of creating new approval level all users with the same role will receive an email notification

for the case of approval
    first message will be sent to approving team (current approval level)
    second message will be sent to next approving level if available
    last message will be sent to a user created an entity( later to be implemented)
